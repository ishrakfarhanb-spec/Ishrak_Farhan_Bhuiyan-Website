# Ishrak_Farhan_Bhuiyan-Website
Designed and developed to showcase my skills, projects, and professional experience. The website is a simple yet elegant portfolio built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, highlighting my work in data analysis, web development, and other areas of expertise. It includes sections like About Me, Projects, Resume, and Contact.

## Deployment (GitHub Pages project site)

This site is deployed to GitHub Pages from the `main` branch using the included GitHub Actions workflow.

### Where it lives
- URL: https://ishrakfarhanb-spec.github.io/Ishrak_Farhan_Bhuiyan-Website/

### Settings
- Settings ? Pages ? Source: GitHub Actions
- `.nojekyll` present to serve static files as-is.

### Notes
- All asset and page links use relative paths (e.g., `assets/...`, `about.html`) so the site works correctly under the project subpath.
