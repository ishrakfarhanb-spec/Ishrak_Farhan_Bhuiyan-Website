        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Hi! I'm <strong>Ishrak Farhan</strong>, Ishrak Farhan Bhuiyan, a Banking & Insurance major at the University of Dhaka, currently ranking in the top 1.25% of my class with a CGPA of 3.85. My journey blends analytical precision, creative curiosity, and leadership across diverse disciplines — from finance and actuarial science to marketing, communication, and editorial strategy.

I’m currently pursuing the Professional Actuarial Study Scholarship (PASS) under the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries (IFoA, UK), awarded by MetLife Bangladesh — a milestone that shaped my passion for risk analytics, financial modeling, and data-driven decision-making.

At the University of Dhaka, I serve as the Deputy Editor of the Voice of Business, where I’ve managed editorial teams, led content strategy for bulletins and magazines, and helped conceptualize creative ideas for national-level events like Brandrill. My prior tenure at Spartans’ Communication Club honed my skills in event organization, public relations, and team management through projects like Sellsation 2022.

Professionally, I’ve worked on marketing and analytics projects with Unilever Bangladesh and Zatiq, focusing on campaign strategy, data interpretation, and process optimization. These experiences deepened my understanding of how business insights and analytics translate into real-world growth and operational efficiency.

Beyond the boardroom, I’m a storyteller, musician, and avid reader. I find balance between analytical rigor and creative rhythm — playing the violin and flute, writing reflective blogs, and constantly exploring new ideas in culture, business, and technology.

My philosophy is simple: learn relentlessly, lead responsibly, and create impact that lasts.</p>
